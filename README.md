# **Blockchain Development Monorepo**

This repository serves as a **parent repository (monorepo)** that links to smaller, focused projects exploring various blockchain concepts and smart contract development. It is a comprehensive collection of my journey into blockchain development. Also, it begins with foundational skills and progressing to advanced topics.

## **Purpose of the Monorepo**

The **Blockchain Development Monorepo** is designed to:  
1. **Organize** related blockchain projects into one central location for ease of navigation and collaboration.  
2. **Document** my learning progress in blockchain development and smart contract programming.  
3. **Showcase** practical implementations of blockchain concepts, security practices, and smart contract optimizations.  
4. **Serve as inspiration** for others who want to follow a similar path into blockchain development.

Each sub-repository represents a self-contained module that focuses on a specific blockchain-related topic.

#### **Blockchain Platforms**  
- **Ethereum (Layer 1):**  
   - Served as the foundational platform for understanding blockchain fundamentals, transactions, and consensus mechanisms.  
   - Focused on decentralized systems, transaction processing, and smart contract deployments.  

- **zkSync Era (Layer 2):**  
   - Explored zkSync as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, focusing on reduced transaction costs and scalability through rollups.  
   - Hands-on experience with bridging assets from Ethereum to zkSync for cross-chain interactions.  
   - Learned about the architecture and benefits of zkSync’s decentralized sequencing and zero-knowledge proof-based security.

#### **Development Tools**  
- **MetaMask:**  
   - Configured MetaMask for Ethereum and zkSync Sepolia testnets to manage wallets and test ETH.  
   - Facilitated secure interactions with decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain networks.  

- **Google Sepolia Faucet:**  
   - Provided Sepolia test ETH for experimenting with Ethereum transactions in a safe environment.  

- **zkSync Bridge:**  
   - Used to bridge ETH from Ethereum’s Sepolia Testnet (Layer 1) to zkSync Sepolia (Layer 2), enabling hands-on experience with cross-chain asset transfers.  

- **Sepolia Etherscan:**  
   - A powerful block explorer for monitoring transaction statuses, gas usage, and wallet activity on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet.  

- **zkSync Era Block Explorer:**  
   - Monitored zkSync Sepolia transactions, providing insights into Layer 2 activity and rollup confirmations.  

#### **Security Tools and Practices**  
- **Cryptographic Principles:**  
   - Gained proficiency in applying cryptography for secure smart contract deployments and transaction validation.  
   - Explored cryptographic hashes and encryption techniques essential for blockchain security.
