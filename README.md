## **What I Learned**

### 1. **Blockchain Fundamentals**
   - Understanding the basics of distributed ledgers and decentralized systems.

### 2. **Consensus Mechanisms**
   - Exploration of how networks agree on transaction validity, including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

### 3. **Smart Contracts**
   - Introduction to building **smart contracts** on the blockchain using Solidity.

### 4. **Nodes**
   - Understanding nodes as the building blocks of blockchain networks.

### 5. **Cryptography**
   - Learning about cryptographic hashes, encryption, and their role in blockchain security.

### 6. **Staying Safe in Blockchain**
   - Best practices for avoiding security risks and interacting safely with blockchain networks.

### 7. **Gas Concepts**
   - Basics of gas fees and advanced optimization concepts for reducing transaction costs.

### 8. **Wallets**
   - Introduction to wallets for managing cryptocurrencies and interacting with dApps.

### 9. **Transaction Signatures**
   - How transaction signatures work and enable secure transfers on the blockchain.

### 10. **L1s, L2s, and Rollups**
   - A foundational understanding of **Layer 1** solutions, **Layer 2** scaling mechanisms, and **rollups**.

### 11. **Interaction with Decentralized Applications (dApps)**
   - Practical experience interacting with blockchain applications and smart contracts.

## **Next Steps**

My **next goal** is to move into **advanced smart contract development and security concepts** with the foundational skills in place. This will include:

- Hands-on experience with **Solidity** for smart contract development.  
- Learning data structures, data types, function calls, and the process of deploying smart contracts.  
- Building real-world examples, testing codebases on testnets, and connecting front-end interfaces to interact with smart contracts.

### **Topics to Explore:**
- Introduction to Solidity  
- Smart contract development and deployment  
- Blockchain oracles  
- Smart contract testing  

By applying these skills, I aim to create secure, functional, and interactive smart contracts that are production-ready.
