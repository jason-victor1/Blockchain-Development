## **What I Learned**

### 1. **Blockchain Fundamentals**
   - Understanding the basics of distributed ledgers and decentralized systems.

### 2. **Consensus Mechanisms**
   - Exploration of how networks agree on transaction validity, including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

### 3. **Smart Contracts**
   - Learned about the purpose and current landscape of smart contracts, including their role in decentralization, security, and transparency.

### 4. **Nodes**
   - Understanding nodes as the building blocks of blockchain networks.

### 5. **Cryptography**
   - Learning about cryptographic hashes, encryption, and their role in blockchain security.

### 6. **Staying Safe in Blockchain**
   - Best practices for avoiding security risks and interacting safely with blockchain networks.

### 7. **Gas Concepts**
   - Basics of gas fees and advanced optimization concepts for reducing transaction costs.

### 8. **Wallets**
   - Introduction to wallets for managing cryptocurrencies and interacting with dApps.

### 9. **Transaction Signatures**
   - How transaction signatures work and enable secure transfers on the blockchain.

### 10. **L1s, L2s, and Rollups**
   - A foundational understanding of **Layer 1** solutions, **Layer 2** scaling mechanisms, and **rollups**.

### 11. **Interaction with Decentralized Applications (dApps)**
   - Practical experience interacting with blockchain applications and smart contracts.

## **Next Steps**

My **next goal** is to move into **advanced smart contract development and security concepts** with the foundational skills in place. This will include:

- Hands-on experience with **Solidity** for smart contract development.  
- Learning data structures, data types, function calls, and the process of deploying smart contracts.  
- Building real-world examples, testing codebases on testnets, and connecting front-end interfaces to interact with smart contracts.

### **Topics to Explore:**
- Introduction to Solidity  
- Smart contract development and deployment  
- Blockchain oracles  
- Smart contract testing  

By applying these skills, I aim to create secure, functional, and interactive smart contracts that are production-ready.

## **Technologies and Tools**

#### **Blockchain**  
- **Ethereum (Layer 1):**  
   - Used to understand blockchain fundamentals, transactions, and consensus mechanisms on the main Ethereum network.  

- **Layer 2 Solutions:**  
   - **zkSync Era:** Explored Layer 2 scaling solutions, learning cross-chain interactions and the benefits of rollups for scalability and low fees.   

#### **Tools**  
- **MetaMask:**  
   - Configured for Ethereum and zkSync Sepolia Testnets to set up wallets and manage test ETH for transactions.  
   - Enabled interaction with decentralized applications and the zkSync bridge.  

- **Google Sepolia Faucet:**  
   - Provided Sepolia test ETH for conducting testnet transactions without financial risk.  

- **zkSync Bridge:**  
   - Facilitated bridging of ETH from Sepolia Ethereum (L1) to zkSync Sepolia (L2), enabling hands-on experience with cross-chain transactions.  

- **Sepolia Etherscan:**  
   - A block explorer used to verify and track transaction statuses, gas fees, and wallet activities on the Sepolia testnet.  

- **zkSync Era Block Explorer:**  
   - Used to monitor transaction confirmations and details on the zkSync Sepolia Testnet for enhanced transparency.  

#### **Security**  
- **Cryptographic Principles:**  
   - Applied cryptography to ensure secure and immutable smart contract deployments.  

- **Gas Optimizations:**  
   - Implemented best practices to minimize gas fees and optimize smart contract efficiency which ensures cost-effectiveness during development and deployment.
